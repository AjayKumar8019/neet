        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Even the most prepared students sometimes fail to perform their best
            on exam day due to poor optimization of Brain Energy Reserves (BER).
          </p>
          <p>
            Brain energy reserves is critical factor for mental readiness and
            availability in the examination hall. This is often due to factors
            beyond academic preparation, such as:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              High Stress and Anxiety: Intense pressure leads to mental blocks
              and hinders clarity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inadequate Time Management: Struggling to allocate time
              effectively during the exam.
            </li>
            <li>
              Overthinking and Self-Doubt: A lack of confidence can derail even
              the best-prepared minds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Poor Focus and Concentration: Distractions or fatigue can lower
              efficiency.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Neglecting Mental Readiness: Focusing only on academics without
            conditioning the mind for high-stakes performance.
