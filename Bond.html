        <h1>Stagewise Service Bond Condition for MBBS</h1>
        <p>
          Pursuing MBBS is a major milestone—but what comes after college is
          just as important to understand. In many Indian states, MBBS
          admissions—especially in government colleges—come with service bond
          conditions that require students to serve in rural areas or pay a
          hefty penalty. At NEET Navigator, we believe you deserve to know the
          full picture before making life-changing choices.

        <h1>Why Should You Care About Bond Conditions?</h1>
        <p>
          Imagine completing your MBBS, only to discover you're legally bound to
          serve in a government hospital for 1–5 years—or pay lakhs as a
          penalty. Sadly, many students find out too late. That’s exactly why we
          built this section of NEET Navigator—to ensure transparency, clarity,
          and peace of mind before you fill your preference list.
